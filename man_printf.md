# _printf - Custom Implementation of printf function

## NAME

_printf - Custom implementation of the printf function

## SYNOPSIS

```c
#include "main.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...);
```

## DESCRIPTION
The _printf function is a custom implementation of the printf function in C. It takes a format string and a variable number of arguments, formats the data according to the format string, and prints the result to the standard output.

## PARAMETERS
+ format: A pointer to a null-terminated format string. This string can contain ordinary characters and format specifiers.
## RETURN VALUE
+ The total number of characters printed on success.
+ -1 if an error occurs.
## FORMAT SPECIFIERS
The format string can contain format specifiers that begin with the '%' character. Each format specifier is followed by an optional set of flags and a conversion specifier. The following format specifiers are supported:

+ %c: Print a single character.
+ %s: Print a string of characters.
+ %d or %i: Print an integer as a signed decimal number.
+ %u: Print an integer as an unsigned decimal number.
+ %o: Print an integer as an octal number.
+ %x: Print an integer as a hexadecimal number (lowercase).
+ %X: Print an integer as a hexadecimal number (uppercase).
+ %b: Print an integer in binary.
+ %p: Print a pointer address.
+ %r: Print a reversed string.
+ %R: Print a string encoded in ROT13.
+ %#: Toggle the '0x' prefix for %x and %X.
+ %+: Print a plus sign for positive numbers.
+ % (space): Print a space for positive numbers.
+ %l: Treat the following format specifier as a long integer.
+ %h: Treat the following format specifier as a short integer.
## EXAMPLES
```c
Copy code
_printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world"); // Prints: "Hello, world!"

int num = 42;
_printf("The answer is %d\n", num); // Prints: "The answer is 42"
```
